# Nudge

Nudge allows you to track daily goals as well as your mood. Define your own goals, update how you're doing daily and over time, gain insights on your habits. Every day Nudge will nudge you to update your goals, rate your day and ask you what you've been up to and how you're feeling.

# Repository

This is a prototype integrating Nudge backend services with `create-react-app`.

# Context

After 4 years of frontend development with Ember.js, I created this repository to experiment with the React ecosystem and compare my experience building frontend apps at scale.

Here is a non exhaustive list of things that I would like to improve:
- Better folder structure with a cleaner prefix.
- 100% test coverage on components
- Finish functional scope 
- Improve components and integration with styled-components.
- Use PWA to make the project usable on mobile.
